**Issue:** Compilation errors in `MainScreen.kt` related to `TabTemplate` and `Screen` lifecycle methods.

**Error Message/Behavior:**
```
e: file:///home/yoel/Development/Android/AACarInfo/car-app-service/src/main/kotlin/com/example/aacarinfo/car/app/service/screens/MainScreen.kt:30:5 'onCreate' overrides nothing
e: file:///home/yoel/Development/Android/AACarInfo/car-app-service/src/main/kotlin/com/example/aacarinfo/car/app/service/screens/MainScreen.kt:79:14 Unresolved reference: setPane
e: file:///home/yoel/Development/Android/AACarInfo/car-app-service/src/main/kotlin/com/example/aacarinfo/car/app/service/screens/MainScreen.kt:89:14 Unresolved reference: setTabs
e: file:///home/yoel/Development/Android/AACarInfo/car-app-service/src/main/kotlin/com/example/aacarinfo/car/app/service/screens/MainScreen.kt:95:43 Unresolved reference: TabSelectionListener
```

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
1.  Initially attempted to use `onCreate`, `onActive`, and `onInactive` lifecycle methods directly on `Screen`, which are not direct overrides. Realized `Screen` is a `LifecycleOwner` and `lifecycleScope` should be used within `init` or `onGetTemplate` for observing `StateFlow`s.
2.  Investigated `TabTemplate` and `Tab` API usage for `androidx.car.app:app:1.3.0-rc01`. Discovered `Tab.Builder` uses `setContainer` instead of `setPane`, and `TabTemplate.Builder.setTabs` requires a `TabSelectionListener` as the first argument.
3.  Added `@OptIn(ExperimentalCarApi::class)` and explicit import for `TabSelectionListener`, but errors persisted, indicating deeper API incompatibility or instability with `TabTemplate` in the specified version.
4.  Decided to pivot from `TabTemplate` due to persistent issues and adopted `PaneTemplate` with `ActionStrip` for navigation between Dashboard and Diagnostics views, which is a more stable and commonly used pattern.
5.  Corrected `PaneTemplate.Builder.setHeaderAction` to accept only an `Action` object, and moved the "Diagnostics" action to `PaneTemplate.Builder.setActionStrip`.
6.  Re-added missing `Template` import.

**Resolution:** Refactoring `MainScreen.kt` to use `PaneTemplate` for navigation and correctly implementing `ActionStrip` for actions resolved all compilation errors related to UI templates and lifecycle. The project now builds successfully.

**Issue:** `Unresolved reference: isAvailable` and `Unresolved reference: status` in `VehicleDataManager.kt` when checking data availability.

**Error Message/Behavior:**
```
e: file:///home/yoel/Development/Android/AACarInfo/vehicle-data-layer/src/main/kotlin/com/example/aacarinfo/vehicle/data/layer/VehicleDataManager.kt:76:48 Unresolved reference: isAvailable
e: file:///home/yoel/Development/Android/AACarInfo/vehicle-data-layer/src/main/kotlin/com/example/aacarinfo/vehicle/data/layer/VehicleDataManager.kt:77:50 Unresolved reference: status
```

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
1.  Initially attempted to use `isAvailable` directly on data objects (e.g., `energyLevel.isAvailable`), which was incorrect.
2.  Attempted to use `status` directly on data objects (e.g., `energyLevel.status`), which was also incorrect.
3.  Realized that `isAvailable` or `status` should be checked on the `CarValue` properties *within* the data objects (e.g., `energyLevel.batteryPercent?.status`).
4.  Added missing import for `androidx.car.app.hardware.common.CarValue`.

**Resolution:** Corrected the availability checks in `VehicleDataManager.kt` to access the `status` property of the relevant `CarValue` objects within each data type (e.g., `energyLevel.batteryPercent?.status`). Added the necessary `CarValue` import. The project now builds successfully.
